                    Initially, the services we provided for our clients centered around the exterior of their
                    properties. However, in 2008 one of our long time customers asked if we would be interested in
                    providing commercial cleaning services for the interior of their office building.
                    <br>
                    It was a natural and sensible addition to the exterior services we were already providing. Our
                    objective is to make the lives of the property managers we work with as issue and worry free as
                    possible.
                </p>


                <p class="t1">Janitorial, Maid and Cleaning Services
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our approach and philosophy to interior commercial cleaning services are exactly the same as our
                    attention to detail on the exterior of the property. Everything must be cleaned exactly as the
                    client expects – nothing left undone and cleaned thoroughly every single visit.
                    <br>
                    Examples of locations where we provide our janitorial services include, but are not limited to:

                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>We are able to staff your location in whatever manner works best for you and your business.

                <p>We recognize every location is different and the needs and expectations vary as well. We provide a
                    wide array of interior janitorial services for all of our clients, including:
                </p>
                <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Vacuuming</li>
                    <li>Carpet Cleaning</li>
                    <li>Dust, Wipe &amp; Sanitize all Horizontal Surfaces</li>

                </ul>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Some of our clients do not require specific rooms or offices to be cleaned at their location.
                    Instead, they only require that the common areas be cleaned that their employees, patrons and
                    tenants access and utilize on a regular basis.
                </p>

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>We are always working to find new solutions for our commercial property clients. Several years ago a
                    client asked if we would be able to “clean-up a vacant store front”.
                    <br>
                    Now, whenever a client has a space, whether it be a retail store front, office, apartment, etc., we
                    are able to provide a full range of services to get the space back in order for them so they are
                    able to quickly rent that space again. These services include:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>

                    <li>Broom Swept &amp; Vacuuming</li>
                    <li>Removal of Racks, Shelving, etc.</li>
                    <li>Window Black Out</li>
